# Load Balancers

* Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.

## Popular Load Balancer Algorithms

1. Round Robin  
2. Weighted Round Robin  
3. Least Connections

## How does LB know if the server is available or not?

### Heart Check
* Your Application Load Balancer periodically sends requests to its registered targets to test their status. These tests are called health checks.  
* The load balancer keeps pinging the server every x seconds.  
* If a server doesn't respond after 3 consecutive attempts, the load balancer assumes the server is dead.  

### Heart Break
* The server is expected to send a request to the load balancer every x seconds.  
* If the load balancer doesn't get any request from the server for 3*x seconds, it assumes the server is dead and removes it.

## How a Load Balancer Forwards Requests to the Server

### Round Robin Algorithm

#### How it Works
* A request is sent to the first server in the list.  
* The next request is sent to the second server, and this process continues.  
* After the last server in the list, the algorithm loops back to the first server.  

#### When to Use
* When all servers have similar processing capabilities and are equally capable of handling requests.  
* When simplicity and even distribution of load are more critical.  

#### Benefits
* Simple to implement and understand.  
* Ensures even distribution of traffic.  

#### Drawbacks
* Does not consider server load or response time.

## Availability and Latency

### Availability
* Availability is a measure of the probability that a particular server or service is operational at any given time.  
* It is typically expressed as a percentage.  
* Formula:  
  **Availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime)**  

### Latency
* Latency refers to the time it takes for a particular operation to complete.  
* Low latency means faster response time and a more responsive system.  
* High latency can lead to lag and poor user experience.

# Database Scaling

There are two broad approaches to database scaling: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.

## Vertical Scaling

* Involves boosting the power of an existing machine within your system to handle increased loads.  
* This can mean upgrading the CPU, RAM, storage, and other hardware components to boost the server's capacity.  

Examples:  
* Upgrading the CPU: Replacing your server's processor with a more powerful one.  
* Increasing RAM: Adding more memory to handle larger datasets.  
* Enhancing Storage: Switching to faster storage (SSDs) or increasing overall storage capacity.  

### Pros of Vertical Scaling
1. Simple setup  
2. Lower latency  

### Cons of Vertical Scaling
1. Single point of failure  
2. Practical limit – can't scale infinitely  
3. Cost increase  
4. Updating application downtime

## Horizontal Scaling

* Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers.  
* Each server runs a copy of the application, and the load is balanced among them, often using a load balancer.  

### Pros of Horizontal Scaling
1. Infinitely scalable  
2. Cost increases linearly  
3. Improved fault tolerance  
4. Better geographical experience  

### Cons of Horizontal Scaling
1. Makes the infrastructure complex  
2. All issues with distributed system data  
3. Increased latency
